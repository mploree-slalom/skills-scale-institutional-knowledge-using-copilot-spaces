# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This README serves as the entry point for new and existing team members to understand our project management structure and quickly find the documentation they need.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to ensure organized, collaborative, and high-quality delivery across teams. The approach begins with clear initiation steps, where business needs are validated, stakeholders are identified, and key success metrics are defined in a Project One-pager. Once an initiative is approved, planning focuses on breaking work into shippable increments, estimating effort, identifying dependencies and risks, and drafting milestone maps with prioritized backlogs. The use of checklists and templates throughout these stages ensures a standardized approach, leading to more predictable and transparent outcomes.

A core aspect of OctoAcme's process is the definition of key personas and roles. Project Managers coordinate delivery, manage schedules, and facilitate communication, while Product Managers own the product vision, prioritize work, and measure results. Developers are responsible for implementing features, maintaining test coverage, and collaborating on design and reviews. QA roles and stakeholders further enhance project rigor by validating quality and providing necessary approvals. This clear role delineation, paired with defined responsibilities and communication channels, helps maintain alignment and drive accountability throughout the lifecycle.

Communication within OctoAcme projects is structured yet adaptable to team needs. Regular cadences include daily or twice-weekly standups focused on progress and blockers, weekly syncs between delivery and product leads, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad hoc escalations as needed. Processes also prescribe regular status updates, risk registers, and decision logs to ensure transparency and effective risk management. Critical paths for escalation are defined, progressing from team-level triage to product leadership and, if needed, sponsor-level intervention.

Quality assurance is woven throughout all workflows. Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests are required in continuous integration environments, with manual QA performed for feature acceptance where necessary. Acceptance criteria are documented and verified before any release, with deployment procedures standardized to minimize risk and enable rollback if needed. Continuous improvement is encouraged via retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents, with action items tracked for measurable impact. This comprehensive system results in consistent, repeatable delivery and empowers teams to learn and evolve their practices collaboratively.
